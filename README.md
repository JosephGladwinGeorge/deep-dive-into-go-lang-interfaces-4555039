<p>Go has a unique approach to some of the methods used in object-oriented programming–particularly with interfaces. In this course, learn how to design and use interfaces in Go. Instructor Miki Tebeka takes a look at various important interfaces in the standard library and examines how interfaces are implemented and the cost of using them. Learn about design decisions behind interfaces and how you can design your own interfaces to be smaller and more performant. And finally, get a look at empty interfaces—including why they’re needed and how you can work with them.</p>
<p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “Getting started with Codespaces” video to learn how to get started.</p>
